# Terraform template for AWS ECS/Fargate

This terraform setup can be used to setup the AWS infrastructure
for a dockerized application running on ECS with Fargate launch
configuration.

## Resources

This setup creates the following resources:

- VPC
- One public and one private subnet per AZ
- Routing tables for the subnets
- Internet Gateway for public subnets
- NAT gateways with attached Elasitc IPs for the prive subnet
- Two security groups
  - one that allows HTTP/HTTPS access
  - one that allows access to the specified container port
- An ALB + target group with listeners for port 80 and 443
- An ECR for the docker images
- An ECS cluster with a service (incl. auto scaling policies for CPU and memory usage)
  and task definition to run docker containers from the ECR (incl. IAM execution role)
